# healthcare

Minimal [Spring Boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) sample app.

## Requirements

For building and running the application you need:

- [JDK 22](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk22-archive-downloads.html)
- [Maven 3](https://maven.apache.org)

## Running the application locally

There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the `main` method in the `com.vignesh.healthcare.HealthcareApplication` class from your IDE.

Alternatively

```shell
mvn spring-boot:run
```
